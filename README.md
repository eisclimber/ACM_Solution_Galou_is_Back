# ACM_Solution_Galou_is_Back
## A Solution to the ACM ICPC2007 for the Problem: "Galou is Back"

This solution was written in GDScript (similar to Python) and uses Godot 3.0. 

Inside the project is a raw solution that only fulfills the minimal requirement of the problem. 
It is located in the folder named raw_code(./Galou_raw.gd).

The rest is a animated graphic representation of the problem. 
It includes a step by step mode and gears can be added/removed.
On the bottom of the screen is a panel with a button to add and one to remove a gear. 
Dragging from the button on a gear will remove/add it. (Initial gears cannot be removed)
